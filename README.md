# CNC_encoder_pad
Wireless Video Editing Macropad and Jog Wheel

## What is it?

The CNC EncoderPad is a Video Editing Macropad with a 60mm Encoder Wheel that's designed for use for CNC machines. This encoder is made of metal and feels like it will last forever. The EncoderPad uses 9 mechanical switches (Cherry MX type). Each key has an individual LED which can be turned on. Since it uses a BlueMicro840, it uses a nRF52840 processor to handle all functions, including BLE.

## Why did I design it?

As I have been editing more videos for the BlueMicro Youtube Channel, I have been looking for a useful macropad that includes a jog wheel that can be re-programmed for various purposes. Since my BlueMicro firmware now supports rotary encoders , I was able to create a purpose-made video editing macropad that's fully programmable using the Arduino IDE.

## How do I program it?

If you are familiar with programming Arduinos or customizing the firmware of your mechanical keyboards programmatically (as opposed through automated online tools), you should find it easy. The firmware used is available on github. There are a number of tutorial videos on how to program the BlueMicro_BLE firmware as well as lots of documentation, examples and help to get going.

The hard part will be to find out what key bindings to use for your favorite software!
